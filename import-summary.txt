ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .DS_Store
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* assets/ => app/src/main/assets
* libs/anreaderlib.jar => app/libs/anreaderlib.jar
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libNdkSupport.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libNdkSupport.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libdevapi.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libdevapi.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libdeviceSerial.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libdeviceSerial.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libhf_switch_jni.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libhf_switch_jni.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libirdaSerialPort.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libirdaSerialPort.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libpinPower.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libpinPower.so
* libs/armeabi/libNdkSupport.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libNdkSupport.so
* libs/armeabi/libdevapi.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libdevapi.so
* libs/armeabi/libdeviceSerial.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libdeviceSerial.so
* libs/armeabi/libhf_switch_jni.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libhf_switch_jni.so
* libs/armeabi/libirdaSerialPort.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libirdaSerialPort.so
* libs/armeabi/libpinPower.so => app/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libpinPower.so
* libs/d2xx.jar => app/libs/d2xx.jar
* lint.xml => app/lint.xml
* res/ => app/src/main/res/
* src/ => app/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
